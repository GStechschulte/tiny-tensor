# tiny-tensor

A minimal tensor library that compiles to XLA inspired by Elodin Systems [Nox](https://github.com/elodin-sys/elodin/tree/main/libs/nox). The primary objective of this repository is two-fold: (1) to learn how to develop a tensor library with a minimal op set, and (2) to learn about the XLA compiler.
